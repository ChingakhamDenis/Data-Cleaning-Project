# Data-Cleaning-Project
Peer-Graded Assignment: Data getting and cleaning
The Script for this project was developed and tesed in Mac OS 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no
questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github 
repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the 
repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

Steps in developing the analysis:
1. Downloads the UCI HAR Dataset data set and puts the zip file and unzip it UCI HAR Dataset folder (Working directory)
2. Using rbind data from data sets train and test is organize into a data frame
3. Using grep the mean and standard deviation from the features data set is extract
4. After cleaning the column names, these are applied to the x data frame.

The following steps are as per instructions in the course and detailed in the run_analysis
