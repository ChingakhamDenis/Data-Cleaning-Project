"# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject" 

The main purpose of the project is to tidy the combined data of subject data, activity data and raw data into a single data frame and tidy the resulting data frame.

The script run_analysis contains the script that combines the different datasets into single data frame and tidy the data so that the following principle of tidy data is meet.

The data is tidy because:
1. Each variable forms a column.2. Each observation forms a row.3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The resulting cleaned data is saved as tidy_data and also uploaded in the same repo
