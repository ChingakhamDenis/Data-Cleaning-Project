"# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject" 

The main purpose of the project is to tidy the combined data of subject data, activity data and raw data into a single data frame and tidy the resulting data frame through the following steps:

1. Download and unzip source data if it doesn't exist.
2. Read data.
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
8. Write the data set to the set_tidy.txt file.

The resulting dataset is tidy data as it satisfies the following principle of tidy data:
1. Each variable forms a column.2. Each observation forms a row.3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.
